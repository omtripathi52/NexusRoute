# 🛡️ NexusRoute Shield: Securing Global Lifelines 

> **Google Solution Challenge India 2026 Entry - Track: [Smart Supply Chains] Resilient Logistics**

![NexusRoute Dashboard](ai-sales-mvp/frontend/src/assets/dashboard_preview.png)

## 📖 Project Overview

**NexusRoute** represents a paradigm shift in global trade risk management. Unlike traditional static dashboards, NexusRoute is an **Agentic AI system** that proactively monitors, analyzes, and mitigates supply chain risks in real-time, solving critical Indian and Global logistics bottlenecks.

> 💡 *"We are not just optimizing spreadsheets; we are securing the lifelines of the global economy."*

### 🌍 Social Value (Potential Impact)

When NexusRoute helps Maersk reroute quickly during the Red Sea crisis, it means:
- 🌾 **Food supplies in Kenya** remain uninterrupted
- 🔥 **Natural gas in Europe** lasts through the winter
- 🏥 **Emergency hospital equipment** doesn't get stuck at ports

This project is a purpose-built MVP designed for the Google Solution Challenge. It simulates a realistic "4:55 PM Crisis Scenario" (geopolitical crisis in the Strait of Hormuz) and fully demonstrates the **AI Chain-of-Thought** and **Human-in-the-Loop** decision-making processes powered by **Gemini 3.1 Pro**.

## 🌟 Core Features 

### 1. 🧠 Visualized AI Chain-of-Thought

- **Real-time Reasoning Display**: Shows the AI's thinking process line-by-line like a "typewriter," no longer a black box.
- **Multi-Agent Debate**: Features an "Adversarial Debate" (Red Team vs. Blue Team) to ensure decision robustness.
- **Citations & Provenance**: Every reasoning step is linked to specific documents in the RAG knowledge base or real-time news sources.

### 2. 🤖 Multi-Agent Collaboration Engine (5-Agent Reasoning Engine)

Features a team of 5 specialized AI Agents working in synergy:

- **🔭 Market Sentinel**: Monitors geopolitical signals from Reuters/Bloomberg (Mock API supports multiple scenarios: Red Sea crisis, port congestion, etc.).
- **🛡️ Financial Hedge Agent**: Real-time analysis of fuel prices, exchange rates, and freight risks. Provides intelligent hedging strategies (futures, options, forwards) for both normal and crisis risk management. Dynamically calculates fuel costs (+$180K) and freight fluctuations after rerouting.
- **🚢 Logistics Orchestrator**: Re-plans routes to avoid conflict zones.
- **📋 Compliance Manager**: Uses **Gemini 3.1 Pro's Extended Context Window** to analyze 500-page insurance policies and sanction lists.
- **⚖️ Adversarial Debate**: Red-teams decisions to prevent hallucinations.

### 3. 🛰️ Visual Risk Intelligence (Satellite Image Analysis)

Leverages **Gemini 3.1 Pro Vision** multimodal capabilities:

- **Satellite Image Analysis**: Real-time detection of port congestion, canal blockages, and container accumulation.
- **Suez Canal Scenario**: Early warning for Ever Given-style events (6 hours before official announcements).
- **Visual Evidence**: Embeds satellite screenshots into decisions as reasoning evidence.

### 4. 📄 Long Document Compliance Analysis

Showcases Gemini's long context window advantages:

- **500-page Maritime Insurance Policies**: Automated parsing and route compliance verification.
- **OFAC/UN Sanction Lists**: Real-time checks (2M tokens context).
- **MLC 2006 Convention**: Automated verification of crew certifications.

### 5. �️ Aviation-Grade Logistics Holographic Map (Deck.gl)

- **Routes & Ports**: Visualizes major global shipping lanes and core ports like Shanghai, Rotterdam, and Los Angeles.
- **Interactive Vessels**: Click on yellow ship icons on the map to view detailed cargo manifests and voyage status.
- **Dynamic Risk**: When a crisis occurs, affected areas highlight and pulse with alerts.

### 6. 👨‍✈️ Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)

- **Decision Confirmation**: After the AI makes a recommendation, a human must click **"Approve & Execute"** for it to take effect, reflecting responsible AI principles.
- **Options**: Provides "Details" and "Override" (manual intervention) options.

### 7. 🔒 Enterprise-Grade Authentication & Security

- **Multi-channel Login**: Integrated with Clerk, supporting Google, Facebook, LinkedIn social logins, and Email/SMS verification.
- **Admin Console**: A visual dashboard designed specifically for administrators to monitor global system KPIs.
- **Security Whitelist**: Email whitelist system based on environment variables to ensure privacy and security of administrative permissions.

### 🔌 Pluggable Data Sources

The **Reasoning Engine** in this project is generic. Current use of Mock data is a Hackathon constraint. Production environments can directly integrate:

| Data Source | Purpose | Replacement Method |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Bloomberg Terminal API | Real-time market data, geopolitical events | Replace `mock_knowledge_base.py` |
| MarineTraffic API | Real-time AIS vessel tracking | Replace `demo/cot_data.py` |
| Sentinel-2 Satellite API | Port/Canal satellite imagery | Replace `visual_risk_service.py` |
| Reuters/Bing News API | Real-time news feeds | Replace Market Sentinel data source |

## 🎯 Target Customers
